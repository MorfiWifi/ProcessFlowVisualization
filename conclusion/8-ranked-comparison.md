Based on the comparison of the provided tools, hereâ€™s a ranking based on a 100-point scale, considering factors like ease of development, flexibility, live data integration, and integration with databases:

| **Tool**                       | **Ease of Initial Development** | **Ease of Modification** | **Minimum Time for Modification** | **Team Size Required** | **Flexibility with Third-Party Assets** | **Integration with Live Data** | **Integration with Database** | **Total Points** |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------|
| **D3.js + Leaflet for Maps**    | 75 (Moderate, requires combining) | 75 (Both libraries need some work) | 70 (Requires coordination between D3 and Leaflet) | 85 (Requires 2-3 devs) | 90 (Combines strengths of both libraries) | 90 (Real-time maps + D3 updates) | 90 (D3 handles dynamic data) | **85**          |
| **Grafana/Power BI**           | 80 (Simple setup, data integration needed) | 85 (Easy customization for dashboards) | 85 (Can update quickly with data changes) | 70 (Low team size) | 90 (Strong ecosystem for plugins and integrations) | 95 (Designed for real-time data) | 90 (Direct database support) | **85**          |
| **D3.js/Chart.js**             | 70 (Some learning curve for complex visualizations) | 80 (Charts are modular and flexible) | 80 (Quick updates with data change) | 75 (Requires 2-3 devs for full customization) | 85 (Great ecosystem for data visualizations) | 80 (Handles real-time with effort) | 85 (Custom database connections) | **81**          |
| **WebGL (PixiJS/Three.js)**    | 60 (High complexity, steep learning curve) | 60 (Requires expertise in graphics) | 50 (Can be time-consuming to adjust visuals) | 90 (Requires specialized graphics developers) | 85 (Highly customizable with assets) | 85 (Requires custom handling for live data) | 75 (Custom data pipelines) | **75**          |
| **Leaflet for Maps**           | 80 (Basic mapping setup is easy) | 85 (Can be extended with plugins) | 75 (Quick updates for map layers) | 70 (Requires 1-2 devs for full integration) | 85 (Flexible with plugins and third-party assets) | 75 (Handles basic real-time updates) | 70 (Can handle geospatial data) | **75**          |
| **SVG/Static Content**         | 90 (Very easy to start)          | 90 (Simple static content changes) | 90 (Quick to modify) | 50 (1-2 devs for basic content) | 50 (Limited flexibility) | 50 (No real-time capabilities) | 50 (No direct integration) | **70**          |

### Ranks:
1. **D3.js + Leaflet for Maps** - **85 Points**
   - Best overall due to its flexibility, ability to handle live data, and integration with databases. Slightly complex but worth the effort for advanced dashboards and mapping.

2. **Grafana/Power BI** - **85 Points**
   - Best for quickly setting up real-time dashboards with minimal effort and is powerful for data visualization. Great if you need quick insights and reporting.

3. **D3.js/Chart.js** - **81 Points**
   - Flexible and good for data visualizations but may need more effort to handle live data. The combination of D3.js and Chart.js is ideal for creating complex charts.

4. **WebGL (PixiJS/Three.js)** - **75 Points**
   - High flexibility and graphics potential but complex and requires specialized expertise. Not the best for simpler data integration or quick modifications.

5. **Leaflet for Maps** - **75 Points**
   - Good for simple map visualizations and moderate real-time capabilities but lacks the advanced data handling features that some of the other options have.

6. **SVG/Static Content** - **70 Points**
   - Very easy for static content but lacks flexibility, real-time integration, and the ability to handle complex data or interactivity.

### Conclusion:
If real-time updates and flexibility are critical for your project, **D3.js + Leaflet for Maps** or **Grafana/Power BI** would be the top choices. If your project needs advanced mapping but with simpler data handling, **Leaflet** is a solid pick. For 3D graphics and complex visualizations, **WebGL** tools are powerful but may be overkill for simpler needs.
