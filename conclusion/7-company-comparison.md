# Comparison based on company metrics

Here's a comparison of the mentioned tools based on the provided metrics:

| **Metric**                                   | **SVG/Static Content**                              | **D3.js/Chart.js**                          | **WebGL-based libraries (PixiJS/Three.js)**     | **Grafana/Power BI**                          | **Leaflet for Maps**                          | **D3.js + Leaflet for Maps**                   |
|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Ease of Initial Development**              | Easy (Static, minimal logic)                        | Moderate (Requires understanding of charts) | Complex (Requires graphics and WebGL expertise)| Moderate (Requires integration setup)          | Easy (Basic mapping setup)                    | Moderate (Requires combining libraries)       |
| **Ease of Modification**                     | Very Easy (Static content is simple)                | Moderate (Chart configurations need tweaks) | Complex (WebGL code may be hard to modify)     | Easy (Data sources integration can be abstracted) | Easy (Can extend with plugins)                | Moderate (Handling both D3 and Leaflet)       |
| **Minimum Time Took for Modification**       | Very Short (Static updates)                         | Moderate (Chart data updates)              | Long (Changes in 3D models are time-consuming) | Short (Data integration done through dashboards) | Short (Adding layers and markers)             | Moderate (Modifications in both D3 and Leaflet) |
| **Number of Developers Engaged**             | 1-2 (Basic static content)                         | 2-3 (Visualizations need developers)       | 3+ (Graphics developers required)             | 1-2 (Dashboard experts and data engineers)     | 1-2 (For map configuration)                  | 2-3 (Both map and data visualization experts)  |
| **Flexibility Using Third-Party Assets**     | Low (Static content, limited flexibility)           | High (Many libraries and plugins available) | High (Many WebGL assets can be used)           | High (Plugins and integrations available)      | High (Multiple plugins for mapping)           | High (Combines data and maps with flexibility)  |
| **Integration with Live Data**               | Moderate (Requires custom handling for live data)   | High (Real-time data for charts is supported)| High (WebSocket or custom pipelines required)  | High (Real-time data support)                  | Moderate (Maps can update with real-time data) | High (Dynamic maps with real-time updates)    |
| **Integration with Database**                | Low (Not a direct integration)                     | Moderate (Requires custom database connections)| Moderate (Needs custom data pipelines)        | High (Can pull directly from databases)        | Moderate (Geospatial data integration)        | High (D3 can handle live data + map integration) |

### Quick Insights:
- **Ease of Development**: SVG/Static content is the easiest to get started with but lacks flexibility. D3.js/Chart.js and Grafana/Power BI are more moderate in complexity, while WebGL-based libraries like PixiJS/Three.js are more complex and demand specific expertise.
- **Flexibility**: D3.js/Chart.js, WebGL libraries, and the combination of D3.js + Leaflet offer high flexibility, especially when combining custom visualizations and maps. Grafana/Power BI and Leaflet also provide flexibility but in different ways (through plugin ecosystems and maps).
- **Live Data Integration**: D3.js and WebGL libraries have the potential for high live data integration, and Grafana/Power BI is excellent for real-time dashboarding. Leaflet for maps can support real-time updates but with limitations on dynamic data visualization.

Each tool has its strengths, so the right choice depends on your specific needs around interactivity, complexity, and team skillset.
