## Real-time Company Overview Schematic for Software Engineers

As software engineers in a large manufacturing company with multiple production lines, raw material piles, storage, and internal transportation (automated and manual), we need a single-view schematic providing real-time insights into operations.  We already have software for maintenance, production, and raw material management.  Our goal is to integrate these systems into a unified dashboard.

Here are a few options for achieving this, considering ease of design, minimal developer engagement, real-time data connectivity, and low maintenance:

**Option 1:  Visual Dashboard with Embedded Widgets**

*   **Description:** A central dashboarding platform (e.g., Grafana, Tableau, Power BI) acts as the primary view. Each area (production line, raw material pile, storage area, etc.) is represented by a visual widget. These widgets embed data from the existing software systems via APIs or direct database connections.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Ease of Design:** High - Drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-built widgets simplify dashboard creation.
    *   **Developer Engagement:** Medium - Initial setup requires some developer work to configure API connections and data transformations.  Subsequent changes can often be handled by dashboard administrators.
    *   **Real-time Connectivity:** High - Most dashboarding tools support real-time data streams and refresh intervals.
    *   **Maintenance:** Low - Changes to the layout or visualization are easily implemented within the dashboard.  API changes in the underlying systems will require some developer intervention.
*   **Example:** Grafana could be used with plugins to connect to databases or APIs of the production, maintenance, and raw material management systems.  Widgets would show key metrics like production output, machine status, stock levels, and transportation activity.

**Option 2:  Custom Web Application with Interactive Map**

*   **Description:** A custom web application is developed, featuring an interactive map of the facility.  Each element on the map (production line, storage area, truck, etc.) is a clickable object that displays detailed information from the respective software systems.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Ease of Design:** Medium - Requires more development effort compared to a dashboard.  Map integration and data visualization logic need to be implemented.
    *   **Developer Engagement:** High - Significant developer involvement is required for initial development and ongoing maintenance.
    *   **Real-time Connectivity:** Medium to High -  Achievable through WebSockets or server-sent events, but requires careful implementation.
    *   **Maintenance:** Medium - Changes to the map, data displayed, or integrations require developer involvement.
*   **Example:** A JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) could be used to build the application.  A mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, Google Maps) would provide the interactive map.  Data would be fetched from the existing systems via REST APIs.

**Option 3:  Hybrid Approach (Dashboard + Map)**

*   **Description:** Combines the benefits of both approaches. A dashboard provides an overview of key metrics, while an embedded interactive map allows for detailed exploration of specific areas or equipment.
*   **Metrics:**
    *   **Ease of Design:** Medium - Requires some development effort for the map integration, but leverages the dashboarding platform for the overview.
    *   **Developer Engagement:** Medium - Less developer-intensive than a fully custom application, but more than a pure dashboard approach.
    *   **Real-time Connectivity:** Medium to High - Achievable through a combination of dashboard features and map integration techniques.
    *   **Maintenance:** Medium -  Similar to the hybrid approach, with maintenance considerations for both the dashboard and the map component.
*   **Example:** A dashboarding platform could be used as the main interface.  An interactive map (built with a mapping library) could be embedded within a specific panel.

**Recommendation:**

For our scenario, the **Visual Dashboard with Embedded Widgets (Option 1)** offers the best balance of ease of design, minimal developer engagement, real-time connectivity, and low maintenance.  It allows us to quickly create a comprehensive overview without significant development overhead.  We can start with this approach and explore more complex solutions (like the Hybrid Approach) if needed in the future.  Focusing on well-defined APIs for our existing systems is crucial for any of these options.
