### **Metrics Details**

1. **Ease of Initial Development**  
   - Measures how straightforward it is to start the project from scratch.  
   - Factors: Availability of frameworks, libraries, and tools; clarity of requirements; team expertise.  
   - Example: Using a framework like React or Angular can speed up initial development.

2. **Ease of Modification**  
   - Measures how easy it is to make changes to the system after deployment.  
   - Factors: Code modularity, documentation, and use of design patterns.  
   - Example: A well-structured codebase with reusable components makes modifications easier.

3. **Minimum Time Took for Modification**  
   - Measures the time required to implement changes or updates.  
   - Factors: Code readability, automated testing, and CI/CD pipelines.  
   - Example: A system with automated testing can reduce modification time significantly.

4. **Number of Developers Engaged During Development**  
   - Measures the team size required to build and maintain the system.  
   - Factors: Complexity of the project, skill level of developers, and collaboration tools.  
   - Example: A smaller team with high expertise may be more efficient than a larger, less experienced team.

5. **Flexibility Using Third-Party Assets**  
   - Measures how easily third-party libraries, APIs, or tools can be integrated.  
   - Factors: Compatibility, licensing, and community support.  
   - Example: Using a charting library like Chart.js or D3.js for visualizations.

6. **Integration with Live Data**  
   - Measures how well the system can handle real-time data from sensors or APIs.  
   - Factors: Data pipeline design, real-time frameworks (e.g., WebSockets), and scalability.  
   - Example: Using WebSockets or MQTT for real-time data streaming.

7. **Integration with Database**  
   - Measures how well the system integrates with databases for storing and retrieving data.  
   - Factors: Database type (SQL vs. NoSQL), ORM tools, and query optimization.  
   - Example: Using PostgreSQL with an ORM like Sequelize for efficient database interactions.

### **Recommendations for Your Team**

1. **Choose the Right Tech Stack**:  
   - Frontend: React (for ease of development and modification).  
   - Backend: Node.js with Express (for real-time data handling).  
   - Database: PostgreSQL (for structured data) or MongoDB (for unstructured data).  
   - Real-Time Data: WebSockets or MQTT.  

2. **Focus on Modularity**:  
   - Use reusable components and microservices architecture to make modifications easier.  

3. **Automate Testing and Deployment**:  
   - Implement CI/CD pipelines to reduce modification time and ensure quality.  

4. **Leverage Third-Party Tools**:  
   - Use libraries like Chart.js, D3.js, or Material-UI for faster development.  

5. **Plan for Scalability**:  
   - Design the system to handle increasing amounts of live data and users.
