### 1. **SCADA Systems (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)**
**Ease of Design:** Medium 
**Minimum Developer Engagement:** Medium 
**Real-Time Data Integration:** High 
**Maintenance Time:** Medium 

SCADA systems are widely used in industrial environments to monitor and control processes. They can provide real-time data visualization, control capabilities, and historical data logging. Integrating SCADA systems with existing software might require some development effort but can be manageable.

### 2. **Industrial IoT Platforms**
**Ease of Design:** High 
**Minimum Developer Engagement:** High 
**Real-Time Data Integration:** High 
**Maintenance Time:** Low 

Platforms like Microsoft Azure IoT or Amazon AWS IoT offer ready-made solutions for connecting devices and gathering real-time data. They often come with intuitive dashboards and analytical tools. These platforms minimize the need for extensive development and are designed to be scalable and easy to maintain.

### 3. **Custom Web-Based Dashboard**
**Ease of Design:** Medium 
**Minimum Developer Engagement:** Low 
**Real-Time Data Integration:** Medium 
**Maintenance Time:** Medium 

Developing a custom web-based dashboard allows you to tailor the solution to your exact needs. Using modern web technologies like React, Node.js, and WebSocket, you can create a real-time, interactive dashboard that integrates various data sources. While it might require more initial development, it gives you complete control over the design and functionality.

### 4. **ERP System with Real-Time Extensions**
**Ease of Design:** Medium 
**Minimum Developer Engagement:** Medium 
**Real-Time Data Integration:** Medium 
**Maintenance Time:** Medium 

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems like SAP, Oracle, and Microsoft Dynamics offer comprehensive solutions for managing business processes. Some ERP systems have real-time extensions or modules that can be integrated for real-time data visualization. These systems often provide extensive support and documentation, making implementation smoother.

### 5. **Digital Twin Technology**
**Ease of Design:** Medium 
**Minimum Developer Engagement:** Medium 
**Real-Time Data Integration:** High 
**Maintenance Time:** Medium 

Digital twins create a virtual replica of physical assets and processes, allowing real-time monitoring and simulation. Integrating digital twins with IoT sensors and data analytics platforms can provide a comprehensive overview of the production lines, raw material management, and internal transportation. While setup might require some initial effort, the benefits of real-time monitoring and predictive analytics are significant.
