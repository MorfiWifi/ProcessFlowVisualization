### Code Description:

This SQL code calculates the shortest path with the minimum delay from a starting node (`Ero-1`) to a destination node (`DEST`) in a graph represented by two tables: `Satelite` (nodes) and `Link` (edges). The graph is traversed recursively using a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `RecursiveCTE`. The goal is to find all possible paths from `Ero-1` to `DEST`, calculate the total delay for each path, and then select the path(s) with the minimum total delay.

### Key Components:
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - `Satelite` table: Represents nodes in the graph. Each node has a unique `NodeName` and `$node_id`.
   - `Link` table: Represents edges in the graph. Each edge has a `$from_id` (source node), `$to_id` (destination node), `Delay` (cost of traversal), and `Bandwidth`.

2. **Recursive CTE (`RecursiveCTE`)**:
   - The CTE recursively explores all possible paths from the starting node (`Ero-1`) to the destination node (`DEST`).
   - **Base Case**: The initial query selects all direct connections from `Ero-1` to its neighboring nodes, initializing the `Path`, `TotalDelay`, and `MinBandwidth`.
   - **Recursive Case**: The recursive part of the CTE joins the current path with new edges, appending the new node to the path, updating the `TotalDelay`, and tracking the minimum bandwidth (`MinBandwidth`) along the path.

3. **Final Selection**:
   - The final `SELECT` statement filters the results to only include paths that end at the destination node (`DEST`).
   - The results are ordered by `TotalDelay` in ascending order, ensuring the path with the minimum delay is listed first.

### Code Comments:

--Ero-1	DEST	{"type":"node","schema":"dbo","table":"Satelite","id":0}	{"type":"node","schema":"dbo","table":"Satelite","id":4}	7	250	Ero-1->Ero-2->Ws-54->DEST	18	200
--Ero-1	DEST	{"type":"node","schema":"dbo","table":"Satelite","id":0}	{"type":"node","schema":"dbo","table":"Satelite","id":4}	7	250	Ero-1->Asia-1->Ws-54->DEST	25	100
--Ero-1	DEST	{"type":"node","schema":"dbo","table":"Satelite","id":0}	{"type":"node","schema":"dbo","table":"Satelite","id":4}	180	20	Ero-1->DEST	180	20

```

### Example Output:
The output shows two paths from `Ero-1` to `DEST`:
1. **Path**: `Ero-1 -> Ero-2 -> Ws-54 -> DEST`
   - **Total Delay**: 18
   - **Minimum Bandwidth**: 200
2. **Path**: `Ero-1 -> Asia-1 -> Ws-54 -> DEST`
   - **Total Delay**: 25
   - **Minimum Bandwidth**: 100

The first path has the minimum total delay (`18`) and is therefore the optimal path based on the given criteria.

### Notes:
- The `MinBandwidth` column tracks the minimum bandwidth along the path, which could be useful for additional constraints or analysis.
- The recursion stops when the destination node (`DEST`) is reached.
- This approach assumes the graph is acyclic or that cycles are handled appropriately (e.g., by avoiding revisiting nodes).
