Here's a detailed comparison between SQL Server Graph Tables and other Graph-Based Approaches (Neo4j, PostgreSQL pgRouting, and traditional relational databases with recursive queries):

Comparison Table: SQL Server Graph Tables vs Other Graph-Based Approaches

Key Takeaways

1. SQL Server Graph Tables are useful if you already use SQL Server and need basic graph operations. However, it lacks built-in shortest path algorithms.


2. Neo4j is the best option for complex graph queries, offering native graph storage and fast traversal.


3. PostgreSQL (pgRouting) is ideal for geospatial and routing-based graph problems, like transport networks.


4. Relational Databases (Recursive CTEs) work for small graphs but are inefficient for deep traversals.

Which One Should You Choose?

If you must use SQL Server, Graph Tables are fine for basic network modeling, but you need recursive CTEs for shortest path calculations.

If you need advanced graph algorithms, Neo4j is the best.

If working with transportation, GIS, or spatial data, use PostgreSQL + pgRouting.

If you only need hierarchical relationships (e.g., organization charts, categories), recursive CTEs in a relational database may be sufficient.
