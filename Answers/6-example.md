To design a network grid using SQL Server Graph Tables and find the best route from Node A to Node Z while allowing modifications to edges (disabling or removing them), we can follow these steps:

---

### **Step 1: Design the Graph Tables**
We will create two tables:
1. **Nodes Table**: Represents the nodes in the network.
2. **Edges Table**: Represents the connections (edges) between nodes, with attributes like bandwidth and delay.

```sql
-- Create Nodes Table
CREATE TABLE Nodes (
    NodeID INT PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier for each node
    NodeName NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL -- Name of the node (e.g., "Node A")
) AS NODE; -- Marks this table as a node table in SQL Server Graph

-- Create Edges Table
CREATE TABLE Edges (
    EdgeID INT PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier for each edge
    Bandwidth INT NOT NULL, -- Bandwidth limitation of the edge
    Delay INT NOT NULL, -- Minimum delay of the edge
    IsActive BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 -- Indicates if the edge is active (1) or disabled (0)
) AS EDGE; -- Marks this table as an edge table in SQL Server Graph
```

---

### **Step 2: Insert Sample Data**
Populate the `Nodes` and `Edges` tables with sample data.

```sql
-- Insert Nodes
INSERT INTO Nodes (NodeID, NodeName) VALUES
(1, 'Node A'),
(2, 'Node B'),
(3, 'Node C'),
(4, 'Node D'),
(5, 'Node Z');

-- Insert Edges (connections between nodes)
INSERT INTO Edges ($from_id, $to_id, Bandwidth, Delay) VALUES
-- Node A -> Node B
((SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 1), (SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 2), 100, 10),
-- Node A -> Node C
((SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 1), (SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 3), 200, 5),
-- Node B -> Node D
((SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 2), (SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 4), 150, 8),
-- Node C -> Node D
((SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 3), (SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 4), 300, 6),
-- Node D -> Node Z
((SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 4), (SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 5), 250, 7);
```

---

### **Step 3: Find the Best Route**
To find the best route from Node A to Node Z, we can use a recursive query that considers active edges and minimizes delay.

```sql
-- Recursive query to find the best route (minimum delay) from Node A to Node Z
WITH BestRoute AS (
    -- Anchor member: Start from Node A
    SELECT
        n1.NodeID AS StartNodeID,
        n2.NodeID AS EndNodeID,
        CAST(n1.NodeName + ' -> ' + n2.NodeName AS NVARCHAR(MAX)) AS Path,
        e.Delay AS TotalDelay,
        n2.NodeID AS LastNodeID
    FROM Nodes n1, Edges e, Nodes n2
    WHERE MATCH(n1-(e)->n2)
    AND n1.NodeName = 'Node A'
    AND e.IsActive = 1

    UNION ALL

    -- Recursive member: Traverse the graph
    SELECT
        br.StartNodeID,
        n2.NodeID AS EndNodeID,
        br.Path + ' -> ' + n2.NodeName AS Path,
        br.TotalDelay + e.Delay AS TotalDelay,
        n2.NodeID AS LastNodeID
    FROM BestRoute br
    JOIN Nodes n1 ON br.LastNodeID = n1.NodeID
    JOIN Edges e ON MATCH(n1-(e)->n2)
    JOIN Nodes n2 ON e.$to_id = n2.$node_id
    WHERE e.IsActive = 1
)
-- Select the best route (minimum delay) to Node Z
SELECT TOP 1
    Path,
    TotalDelay
FROM BestRoute
WHERE EndNodeID = (SELECT NodeID FROM Nodes WHERE NodeName = 'Node Z')
ORDER BY TotalDelay ASC;
```

---

### **Step 4: Modify Edges (Disable or Remove)**
You can disable or remove edges dynamically to simulate network changes.

#### Disable an Edge:
```sql
-- Disable the edge between Node A and Node C
UPDATE Edges
SET IsActive = 0
WHERE $from_id = (SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 1)
AND $to_id = (SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 3);
```

#### Remove an Edge:
```sql
-- Remove the edge between Node B and Node D
DELETE FROM Edges
WHERE $from_id = (SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 2)
AND $to_id = (SELECT $node_id FROM Nodes WHERE NodeID = 4);
```

---

### **Step 5: Re-run the Best Route Query**
After modifying the edges, re-run the `BestRoute` query to see how the changes affect the pathfinding.

---

### **Explanation of the Code**
1. **Graph Tables**:
   - `Nodes` table stores the nodes (e.g., Node A, Node B).
   - `Edges` table stores the connections between nodes, with attributes like `Bandwidth` and `Delay`.

2. **Recursive Query**:
   - The `WITH BestRoute` CTE (Common Table Expression) recursively traverses the graph, starting from Node A and exploring all active edges.
   - It calculates the total delay for each path and keeps track of the path taken.

3. **Edge Modifications**:
   - You can disable edges by setting `IsActive = 0` or remove them entirely using `DELETE`.

4. **Best Route Selection**:
   - The final `SELECT` statement retrieves the path with the minimum total delay to Node Z.

---

### **Example Output**
For the initial data, the query might return:
```
Path: Node A -> Node C -> Node D -> Node Z
TotalDelay: 18
```

After disabling the edge between Node A and Node C, the query might return:
```
Path: Node A -> Node B -> Node D -> Node Z
TotalDelay: 25
```

This design allows you to model a network grid, find optimal routes, and dynamically modify the network while leveraging SQL Server Graph Tables.
