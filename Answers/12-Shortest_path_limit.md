The `SHORTEST_PATH` function in SQL Server's graph database feature is designed to find the **shortest path** based on the **number of hops** (edges) by default. It does not natively support evaluating paths based on edge properties like **delay** or **bandwidth**, nor does it provide a list of all possible paths.

To achieve your goal of finding the shortest path based on properties like **delay** or **bandwidth**, you would need to implement a custom solution, such as using a **recursive CTE (Common Table Expression)** or leveraging a dedicated graph database like **Neo4j** that supports weighted shortest path algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm).
