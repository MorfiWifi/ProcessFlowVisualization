The `SHORTEST_PATH` function in SQL Server is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It is part of SQL Server's graph database capabilities and allows you to traverse the graph by specifying the start and end nodes, as well as the conditions for traversal.

### **How to Use `SHORTEST_PATH`**
1. **Syntax**:
   ```sql
   SHORTEST_PATH(<start_node>, <end_node>, <edge_table> [, <condition>])
   ```
   - `<start_node>`: The starting node in the graph.
   - `<end_node>`: The ending node in the graph.
   - `<edge_table>`: The edge table that defines the relationships between nodes.
   - `<condition>` (optional): A filter condition to restrict the edges used in the traversal.

2. **Returns**:
   - A table containing the path from the start node to the end node, including the nodes and edges traversed.

### **Example: Finding the Shortest Path Between Two Satellites**
Given the table structure:
```sql
CREATE TABLE Link (
    EdgeID INT PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier for each edge
    Bandwidth INT NOT NULL, -- Bandwidth limitation of the edge
    Delay INT NOT NULL, -- Minimum delay of the edge
    IsActive BIT NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 -- Indicates if the edge is active (1) or disabled (0)
) AS EDGE; -- Marks this table as an edge table in SQL Server Graph

CREATE TABLE Satelite (
    NodeID INT PRIMARY KEY, -- Unique identifier for each node
    NodeName NVARCHAR(50) NOT NULL -- Name of the node (e.g., "Node A")
) AS NODE; -- Marks this table as a node table in SQL Server Graph
```

#### **Scenario**:
Find the shortest path between two satellites (nodes) based on the `Link` edge table, considering only active edges (`IsActive = 1`).

#### **Query**:
```sql
-- Find the shortest path between two satellites (e.g., NodeID 1 and NodeID 5)
SELECT 
    STRING_AGG(s.NodeName, ' -> ') AS Path, -- Concatenate node names to show the path
    SUM(l.Delay) AS TotalDelay, -- Calculate total delay along the path
    MIN(l.Bandwidth) AS MinBandwidth -- Find the minimum bandwidth along the path
FROM 
    SHORTEST_PATH(
        (SELECT $node_id FROM Satelite WHERE NodeID = 1), -- Start node
        (SELECT $node_id FROM Satelite WHERE NodeID = 5), -- End node
        Link, -- Edge table
        IsActive = 1 -- Condition: Only active edges
    ) AS sp
JOIN Satelite s ON sp.$node_id = s.$node_id -- Join to get node names
JOIN Link l ON sp.$edge_id = l.$node_id; -- Join to get edge details
```

---

### **Explanation**:
1. **`SHORTEST_PATH` Function**:
   - Starts at the node with `NodeID = 1` and ends at the node with `NodeID = 5`.
   - Uses the `Link` edge table to traverse the graph.
   - Only considers edges where `IsActive = 1`.

2. **Joins**:
   - Joins the result of `SHORTEST_PATH` with the `Satelite` table to get the names of the nodes in the path.
   - Joins with the `Link` table to get details about the edges (e.g., delay, bandwidth).

3. **Aggregations**:
   - `STRING_AGG`: Concatenates node names to show the path.
   - `SUM(l.Delay)`: Calculates the total delay along the path.
   - `MIN(l.Bandwidth)`: Finds the minimum bandwidth along the path (useful for identifying bottlenecks).

---

### **Output**:
The query will return:
- **Path**: A string showing the sequence of nodes (e.g., "Node A -> Node B -> Node C").
- **TotalDelay**: The sum of delays along the path.
- **MinBandwidth**: The minimum bandwidth along the path.

---

### **Notes**:
- Ensure that the graph is properly connected and that the `Link` table contains valid edges between the nodes.
- If no path exists between the specified nodes, the query will return an empty result.
- You can modify the conditions in `SHORTEST_PATH` to include additional constraints (e.g., maximum delay, minimum bandwidth).
