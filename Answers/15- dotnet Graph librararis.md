### 8. **Neo4j .NET Driver**
   - **Description**: If you're working with graph databases, the Neo4j .NET driver allows you to interact with Neo4j, a popular graph database, and perform graph queries using Cypher.
   - **Features**:
     - Query graph databases using Cypher.
     - Integrate with Neo4j for large-scale graph analysis.
   - **NuGet**: `Neo4j.Driver`

### 9. **LightGraphs.jl (via .NET Interop)**
   - **Description**: While not a native .NET library, LightGraphs.jl (a Julia library) can be used via .NET interop for advanced graph analysis and algorithms.
   - **Features**:
     - Advanced graph algorithms.
     - High-performance graph analysis.
   - **GitHub**: [LightGraphs.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl)
