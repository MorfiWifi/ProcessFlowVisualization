0. consider we software engeneers and assume we are in large company producing goods and it has multiple production lines , raw material pile , storage and internal transportation (using automated lines or manually using trucks) , and we have software for each section of company example maitenance , production , raw material management , waht we want is shcematic of company with real time details about what and how thing are going on with single loock , consider following meterics for options you provide , ease of designe , minimum developer ingagement , ability to connect to realtime sevices or show data from other sources , minimum maintenance time for appling changes
1. what is SCADA and how use it , provide some realworld sample and demos ? how can they be use and integrated with web base systems ?
2. consider we software engineers and assume we are in large company producing goods and it has multiple production lines , raw material pile , storage and internal transportation (using automated lines or manually using trucks) , and we have software for each section of company example maintenance , production , raw material management , what we want is schematic of company with real time details about what and how thing are going on with single look , considering that out existing app are web base and we have large software developer team available , define metrics to choose a design system or go on for strategy that satisfies this need , write metrics in table 
2. now list these metrics , and provide options that we have (libraries , platforms , ...) we are currently using svg files that designed by designer and connected to application by developer effort , is this a good way ? compare with other options . list alternatives in table format
